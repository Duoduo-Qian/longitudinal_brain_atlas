# longitudinal_brain_atlas
This is the appendix file of the paper “An Artificial-intelligence-based Age-specific Atlas Construction Framework for Brain Structural Analysis Using MR Images”. The brain atlases are constructed from 646 subjects from 18 to 82 years old in 4 medical centers. T1 atlases, T2 atlases, T2 FLAIR atlases, T1 mapped atlas, and tissue (Grey matter, white matter and CSF) probability maps are all available. The 13 atlases from 20 to 80 years old at a 5 year interval are in 13 components and can be found in the .nii.gz files.
